    "### Metrics:\n",
    "* Click-Through Rate (CTR) is calculated as “CTR = [Total Measured Clicks / Total Measured Ad Impressions] X 100”, where “total measured clicks” is the total amount of clicks on an ad; “total measured ad impressions” is the number of times an ad was loaded on a page. Click-through rates measure how successful an ad has been in capturing users' attention. The higher the click-through rate, the more successful the ad has been in generating interest.\n",
    "* Return on Investment (ROI) is calculated as “[(Amount Gained – Amount Spent) / Amount Spent] X 100”, where “amount gained” is the amount of income that has been generated by an investment; “amount spent” is the total amount spent on an investment. ROI stands for Return on Investment and means the amount of money you get back relative to the amount of money you put into something. It is different to profit, which is simply the amount spent subtracted from the amount earned. ROI goes a step further and works out profit per the amount spent. This answers the question – how much profit can I earn per pound/dollar/euro etc spent.\n",
    "* Average Page Time is calculated as “Average Page Time = [Σ(Time Spent on a Page by a User) / Number of Users]”, where “time spent on a page by a user” is time measured for each user who visits a webpage; “number of users” is the number of users who visit a webpage. Keep in mind, that usually users who spend less than 5 seconds on a webpage are not included in the calculations. Hint! You might think about parameters passed to a function as one of Python series structures.\n",
    "* Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is calculated as “CLV = [(Average Purchase Value – Average Purchase Frequency) X Average Customer Lifespan]” and used to predict how much revenue a customer will drive over time. To get more information how this metric is calculated, follow this link.\n",
    "* Conversion Rate (CR) which is calculated as “CR = [Total Attributed Conversion / Total Measured Clicks] X 100”, where “total attributed conversion” is the total amount of conversion recorded which have been caused clicks; “total clicks” – number of times an ad was clicked on.\n",
    "* Purchases Not Completed is calculated as “Not Completed = [Purchases Initiated - Purchases Completed]”, where “Purchases Initiated” is the total amount of loaded items into electronic baskets; “Purchases Completed” is the total amount of purchased items. Purchases not completed measure the number of purchases that were not completed.\n",
    "* Abandonment Rate is calculated as “Abandonment Rate = [Purchases Not Completed / Purchases Initiated] X 100”, where “Purchases not completed” is the number of purchases that were not completed; “Purchases Initiated” is the total amount of loaded items into electronic baskets. Abandonment rate measure the percentage of shopping carts that are abandoned.\n",
    "* Cost Per Click is calculated as “Cost per click = [Cost Per Week / Clicks Per Week]”, where “Cost Per Week” is the total spent on paid search engine advertising during one week; “Clicks Per Week” is this the total amount of users clicks. Cost per click is the most important concept in search engine marketing. Cost per click is widely quoted and used by search engine companies in charging for their services. Marketers use cost per click to build their budgets for search engine payments."
