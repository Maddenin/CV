    "Let me explain how my ticket aggregator works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logic blocks\n",
    "First, we must understand the conditions of the task.\n",
    "There are four criteria (the ticket price, the number of transfers, a refund, and luggage) and four offer categories (the best, good enough, bad, other) for flight classification. We must write a program that gets as input the data on these criteria. The data is entered from the keyboard. Then the program should classify an offer based on these criteria and print on the screen an offer category and this offer's description.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, my program must:\n",
    "* Be polite. Print welcome words for the user.\n",
    "* Get input from the keyboard:\n",
    "* As we have four criteria – there should be four categories: “the ticket price” must be a float, the number of transfers – integer, “refund” and ‘’ luggage’ – Boolean\n",
    "* Transform the data and check whether the data are entered in a right way\n",
    "* Classify an offer by four categories (the best, good enough, bad, other).\n",
    "* Print on the screen an offer category and offer's description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program blocks\n",
    "I have used logic blocks structure for the program blocks, but expanded with technical moments:\n",
    "* For the welcome text I use the function “welcome”. It’s very simple. The only moment to explain is \"getpass\" library to get the user’s login name. And I use variables for printing text separators.\n",
    "* For keyboard input I use function \"get_criteria\". It expects keyboard input and returns four values (float, int, bool, bool). I use \"try-input-except\" construction for checking (by ValueError) whether the keyaboard input has the right format. Moreover, I use a separate function \"get_bool\" to match (by dictionary) keyboard input for TRUE \\ FALSE Boolean states.\n",
    "* For classification I use function classify. It has Boolean conditions and if-elif-else constructions.\n",
    "* For result printing, I use the main function \"result\" and function \"convert_bool\" for Boolean states matching on people language, and class \"text\" for text formatting, and dictionary \"offer_dict\" for the offer's type and the offer's description matching.\n",
    "* Al functionality (except welcome) is on while loop as long as the user wants the program to classify new offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current version advantages and disadvantages\n",
    "Criteria and categories are ok for me, except the pets option. So I have added it into classification and changed the logic for \"good enough\" and \"bad\" categories:\n",
    "* I changed the price range for 'good enough offer' (Price <= 250)\n",
    "* I replaced the logic \"AND\" with logic \"OR\" for 'the bad offer'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the improved version, I focused on enhancing the user experience by adding a graphical interface."
